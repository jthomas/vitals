# Hello Vitals.

A stateful serverless web app to record daily vitals. 

API backend and static web assets are hosted by the [Nimbella Platform](https://nimbella.com). It uses [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) as the database. Follow the instructions below to deploy this application in your own Nimbella namespace.

## Set up the database backend

This application uses [Fauna](https://fauna.com/) to store the daily vital measurements. 

[Fauna](https://fauna.com/) is a document database - it stores native JSON object as individual documents. Documents are grouped into Collections. Documents and Collections are be queried using Fauna's custom query language (FQL).

Here is the JSON schema used for the measurements in this web application.

```json
{
  "bp_diastolic": 90,
  "bp_systolic": 140,
  "glucose_level": 5,
  "pulse": 100,
  "timestamp": "2021-02-18 17:04:09"
}
```

Before you can deploy the Nimbella application, you need to sign up for a Fauna account, provision a new database, create a collection and then provision an authentication token. 

### Sign up for a Fauna account

- Visit [https://fauna.com/](https://fauna.com/) and follow the instructions to sign up for an account.

### Provision a new database

## Update the Nimbella project configuration

- Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`
- Fill in the environment parameters with your values from above:
  - FAUNADB_COLLECTION="YOUR COLLECTION NAME"
  - FAUNADB_SECRET="SECRET FROM FAUNA CONSOLE"

## Deploy The Nimbella Project

*This step assumes you have [already signed up](https://nimbella.com/signup) for an account with the Nimbella platform, [installed the CLI tool](https://docs.nimbella.com/install) and [configured authentication](https://docs.nimbella.com/namespaces) for your namespace. If you need help with any of these steps please see documentation [here](https://docs.nimbella.com/).*

- Run the project deploy command from your CLI

  ```
  nim project deploy .
  ```

If the deployment was successful, the following logs should be shown:

```
